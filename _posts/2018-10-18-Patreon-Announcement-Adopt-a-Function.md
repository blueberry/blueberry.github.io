Hi! If you're reading this blog regularly, you probably already know about my dedication to [Neanderthal](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org) and other [Uncomplicate](https://github.com/uncomplicate) Clojure libraries for high-performance computing in Clojure.

I opened [a Patreon page for donations](https://patreon.com/draganrocks). And I think I have a nice idea to appreciate financial contributions:

**You can become a proud [sponsor of a pet Clojure function](https://patreon.com/draganrocks) from one of Uncomplicate projects! I will add your name to the
documentation data of a function, so you can follow the project and take care that your function is happy and free of bugs!**

If you landed here because (I hope!) this post got shared a lot, and wonder what I'm talking about, check out:

1. [The About page of this blog](https://dragan.rocks/about)
2. [My GitHub repository](https://github.com/uncomplicate) of several projects that I've been developing for a long time
3. [The tutorials I regularly write](https://dragan.rocks/about)

As an open-source Clojure enthusiast yourself, you probably know how much time goes into this thing we both love: developing and sharing high-quality Clojure code and growing the Clojure ecosystem. As much as I like spending countless hours on these libraries, there is a huge opportunity financial cost that I have to bear myself.

[Neanderthal](https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org), [ClojureCUDA](https://clojurecuda.uncomplicate.org), [ClojureCL](https://clojurecl.uncomplicate.org) and others are free for everyone, but cost me many thousands of dollars in missed earnings from the consulting jobs I have to refuse to be able to work on this. I still stand by my choice, and do not regret doing that. And it will be nice if I can organize financial support to make sure that I can continue doing so!

You can help by going to [a Patreon page for donations](https://patreon.com/draganrocks) and pledging an amount that you can afford. I really appreciate your help!

In return, you can [claim a Neanderthal function as your own pet](https://patreon.com/draganrocks)! Think about that, you can be someone who generously support and care about Neanderthal so much that a doc metadata of a function lists you as its patron!

Regardless of the success of this campaign, I pledge to continue delivering high quality high speed open source code to the Clojure community, so do not worry if you can't afford to [donate](https://patreon.com/draganrocks). But it will be really nice if you can :)

**Please share this post and spread the word.**
