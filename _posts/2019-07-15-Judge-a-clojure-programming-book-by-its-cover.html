I love reading. I love when books have nice typography, when they are printed on nice paper,
and bound into a hardcover that has just the right touch. The content becomes
unforgettable.
</p>

<p>
When I see a cover of an old (comic) book, I'm instantly teleported
back in time when I my mom bought it for me on the way to the kindergarten.
The experience was so memorable that I still remember every detail
of the episodes I read as a five year old, while I regularly forget
what I've read this morning.

<p>
It would have been awesome if the covers of <a href="https://aiprobook.com"><i>my</i> books</a> could be drawn by these masters.
</p>

<p>
Back to reality. A great thing about programming books is that they regularly have nice covers.
Having a honey badger on the book that is not about zoology is cool in a nice geeky way.

<p>
I needed an idea for the covers of the book series that I'm writing,
<a href="https://aiprobook.com"><i>Interactive Programming for Artificial Intelligence</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
My budget was (close to) zero, and I can't call myself an artist. Many ideas came
and went by; none of them was distinctive enough. They weren't communicating the
main message of the book series well.
</p>

<p>
The main message of the book series? Aren't these just
some tutorials teaching some contemporary programming skills? I hope they are
more than that!
</p>

<p>
The series has an <i>interactive</i> approach. Every concept that I'm writing
about is immediately illustrated with executable code. You can try it right away
in Clojure's amazing super-console: <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">the REPL</a>, the genuine connection between
the programmer and the running program.
</p>

<p>
These are <i>programming</i> books. They go beyond theory, and they do not stop
at cute demos. The code you'll write is fast. It's flexible and extendable.
The real thing. Comprehensive, but approachable.
</p>

<p>
Not all of the books are strictly about <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>,
they are about programming foundations that are important
in building AI software.
</p>

<p>
These are several challenging areas on their own. Math: tough. AI: abstract.
Functional programming: funky. High performance computing on the GPU: get out of here!
Together? A tough sell!
</p>

<p>
Finally, the answer fell into my lap. Meet Dog and Bird, the two friends
that bravely immerse into challenging activities and make them effortless and fun!
</p>

<p>
It's great for beginners. It's not easy, but everything is simply explained.
You don't have to be an expert to start, but you will become one as you progress.

The flagship book is <a href="https://aiprobook.com/deep-learning-for-programmers/">Deep Learning for Programmers: An Interactive Tutorial with CUDA, OpenCL, MKL-DNN, Java, and Clojure.</a>
</p>

<p>
Instead of me giving you <a href="https://aiprobook.com/deep-learning-for-programmers/">the pitch</a>, let Dog and Bird show you what it's all about.
Yes, if a dog and a bird can surf the waves, you, a programmer, can conquer deep learning.

Math might have thorns, but look at how Dog and Bird easily handle it with love.
