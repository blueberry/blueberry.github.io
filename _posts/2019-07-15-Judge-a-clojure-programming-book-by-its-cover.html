I love reading. I love when books have nice typography, when they are printed on nice paper,
and are bound with a hardcover that has just the right touch. The content becomes
unforgettable.
</p>

<p>
When I see the cover of an old (comic) book, I'm instantly teleported
back in time to when my mom bought one for me on the way to kindergarten.
The experience of these comics were so memorable that I remember every detail
of the issues I read as a five year old, while I regularly forget
what I've read this morning.

It would be awesome if the covers of <a href="https://aiprobook.com"><i>my own</i> programming books</a> could be created by these masters.
</p>

<p>
Back to reality. A great thing about most programming books is that they do regularly have nice covers.
Having a honey badger on a book that's not about zoology is cool, in a nice geeky way.

<p>
I needed an idea for the covers of the series of books that I'm writing,
<a href="https://aiprobook.com"><i>Interactive Programming for Artificial Intelligence</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
My budget was (close to) zero, and I can't call myself an artist. Many ideas came
and went; none of them were distinctive enough. They weren't communicating the
message of the book series.
</p>

<p>
The main message of the book series? These aren't just
tutorials teaching some contemporary programming skills. I hope they are
much more than that!
</p>

<p>
This book series has an <i>interactive</i> approach. Every concept I'm writing
about is immediately illustrated with executable code. You can try it right away
in Clojure's amazing super-console: <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">the REPL</a>, which provides a genuine connection between
the programmer and the running program.
</p>

<p>
These are <i>programming</i> books. They go beyond theory, and they do not stop
at cute demos. The code you'll write is fast, flexible and extendable.
The real thing. Comprehensive, but approachable.
</p>

<p>
Not all of the books are strictly about <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>,
they are also about the programming foundations that are important
in building AI software.
</p>

<p>
These are several challenging areas on their own. Math: it's tough. AI: it's abstract.
Functional programming: it's funky. High performance computing on the GPU: get out of here!
Together? It's a tough sell!
</p>

<p>
Finally though, the answer fell into my lap. Meet Dog and Bird, they are two friends
that bravely immerse themselves into challenging activities and make them effortless and fun!
</p>

<p>
These books are great for beginners. It's not easy, but everything is simply explained.
You don't have to be an expert to start, but you will become one as you progress.

<p>
The flagship book in the series is <a href="https://aiprobook.com/deep-learning-for-programmers/">Deep Learning for Programmers: An Interactive Tutorial with CUDA, OpenCL, MKL-DNN, Java, and Clojure.</a>
</p>

<p>
Instead of me giving you <a href="https://aiprobook.com/deep-learning-for-programmers/">the pitch</a>, let Dog and Bird show you what it's all about.
Yes, if a dog and a bird can surf the waves, you, a programmer, can conquer deep learning.

The second book in the series is <a href="https://aiprobook.com/img/lafp-cover.png">Numerical Linear Algebra for Programmers: An Interactive Tutorial with GPU, CUDA, OpenCL, MKL, Java, and Clojure.</a>
Math might have thorns, but look at how Dog and Bird easily handle it with love.
