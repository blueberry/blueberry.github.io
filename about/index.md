My name is Dragan Djuric. Here's a few words about me and what you can expect to find on this blog.

When I'm not running, working out, dancing, reading, and pleasantly wasting time, I'm working on [Uncomplicate Clojure libraries](http://uncomplicate.org). What time is left, I spend it as a professor of software engineering at [University of Belgrade](http://bg.ac.rs/en/index.php). I am a member of [Good Old AI Network](http://goodoldai.org/people), a group of researchers that share a similar passion for intelligent systems.

I live in [Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade), [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia); if you are curious, it's in the southern part of Europe, just across the Adriatic Sea from Italy, to the North-West.

I started using [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) as my main programming language in 2009 (wow, that was long ago!), and I also managed to sneak it into the curriculum in 2010 (don't ask me how I managed to do that), so I also teach it at the university. One thing lead to another, and soon enough, I started using [Emacs](http://batsov.com/prelude/) as my primary development environment. I am also interested in machine learning, and, since I'm often hard-headed, that means the probabilistic, Bayesian kind of machine learning, data analysis, and related fields.

This blog is a place where I'll write about my journey of trying (and eventually succeeding, i hope!) of making [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) a great environment for [high-performance numerical computing](http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/definition/high-performance-computing), [GPU computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units), [Bayesian data analysis](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.rs/), and [probabilistic machine learning](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/). How do I hope to do that?

1. By sharing here some thoughts about the things I'm experimenting with, learning, or working on, and *inspiring you* to join in.
2. By creating open source Clojure libraries that can *help you apply what i "preach"*; you can find those at [Uncomplicate Clojure Project](http://uncomplicate.org). Make sure you check it out, it already provides excellent, working, state-of-the-art performance!
