Hello, my name is Dragan Djuric, and I'm here to present a topic we all love: programming.
And, not just any regular kind of programming, but the cool one: interactive programming.
I know, interactive programming is old news. How about interactive programming for Artificial Intelligence?
I hope that's interesting enough.

Here's my contact details, in case you'd like to find out more. I am a professor of software engineering at
the University of Belgrade. I've been using Clojure as my primary programming language since 2009,
I teach it since 2010. You can find me on github, and you can find lots of related Clojure articles on my blog.

What is Interactive Programming for Artificial Intelligence?
</p>

<p>
It is a book series on topics related to AI/ML/DL written with programmers in mind.
The flagsip book is Deep Learning for Programmers.
</p>

<p>
It's a miracle cure for some theory phobias.
We, the programmers, learn best by coding, not by reading dry theory.

There's another cure for the math-phobia that many programmers have.
You are not alone. But, <b>applied</b> math is not hard when you approach it from

Artificial Intelligence is a field of study with a particularly elusive definition.
Most definitions agree on it being about artificial devices that perceive their
environment and take actions with the aim of achieving some goals. Broad enough.
</p>

<p>
These machines appear to be "intelligent" by mimicking human cognitive functions
such as ability to learn from the input and solve problems.

<p>
Since AI is hyped so much at the moment, you've might heard about AI Winter.
</p>

<p>
During the last 60 years, AI-related research lived through several boom/bust cycles,
where some cool prototypes lead to over-promising grand objectives, which lead to
huge funding grants, then hit the technological limits. The government becomes disillusioned,
cuts all funds, and the hype turns into depression, thus AI Winter.
</p>

<p>
After some time, a new cycle starts with a different approach, and repeats.
</p>

<p>
The good things is that, once the dust settles, there are things that work,
we just don't consider it AI once the magic wears out.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Most of today's successes in AI are in a sub-field called machine learning.
</p>

<p>
Machine learning is about algorithms that learn to perform a specific task
without being given explicit instructions.
</p>

<p>
They usually involve using statistical inference to extract patterns from
existing data and build a model that can then be used to make predictions
on new data.

Deep Learning is just a re-branding of Neural Networks, which were part

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Neural networks do not really consist of neurons, nor they resemble
biological neurons beyond mere analogy. They are literally matrix multiplications
interposed with non-linear vectorized activation functions.
</p>

<p>
The key challenge is finding efficient ways to populate
the matrices with useful values. This is the thing that has
to be automatically learned from data and is conceptually simple,
but fragile in practice.

Now, it's time to put these numbers into the appropriate high-performance
tensors. We take one part of the data for training, and transfer it into
Neanderthal's matrices, which are 2-d tensors. We don't need anything more sophisticated
for this example, so we keep it simple.
</p>

<p>
We end up with the matrix of all inputs and the matrix of all expected outputs.

Clojure's awesomeness to implement a nice API.

The DLFP book explains in detail what to do, when, and how.

One hint about why Neural Networks were difficult to apply for
a long time: even though this is a small network, it does have 5000
parameters to learn from data, through many iterations!

We created the network that can do the inference once it is filled with
the right values, but we have to provide the learning infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
We implement this step by step in the book, and provide the API that
does everything once a few key informations are specified.

<p>
In this case, we will use Stochastic Gradient Descent with Adaptive Moments,
short: ADAM.

When we grade human students, we usually don't value how well they can parrot
the text from the book back. We give them new problems, that are not too
dissimilar from what they had seen before, and we see how well they perform.
</p>

<p>
It's the same with NN. We saved a portion of original data, which
the network has never seen during training, and use THAT for testing.

We test it by measuring the distance from network's guesses
to the real values known to us but unknown to the network.
</p>

<p>
In this case, the network is 2.7 thousands dollars off from the
real value, on average, which is not bad.
</p>

<p>
This problem is actually not a great fit for NNs, since it
has few rows, so other statistical tools can be applied on it too.
</p>

<p>
The key advantage of NNs is that they do not require much preparation
and they do the analysis more or less automatically. Other techniques
usually require more human involvement in tidying data up, even for
such simple examples.

So, we have created a nice NN tool that is faster that mainstream
frameworks, if having less bells and whistles.
</p>

<p>
And the key part of the implementation is these 6 lines of code!
</p>

<p>
Isn't Clojure amazing? A quite sophisticated backpropagation learning algorithm
with Adaptive Moments, weight decay etc. in mere 7 lines of quite readable code!
