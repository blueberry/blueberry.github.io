- [ClojureCUDA](http://clojurecuda.uncomplicate.org): Clojure & Java GPU programming at full speed on Nvidia hardware
- [ClojureCL](http://clojurecl.uncomplicate.org): Clojure & Java GPU programming at full speed on AMD, Intel & Nvidia hardware
- [Bayadera](http://github.com/uncomplicate/baradera): Clojure & Java Bayesian Data Analysis on the GPU Library
- [Most of my code on GitHub is part of Uncomplicate](http://github.com/uncomplicate)
